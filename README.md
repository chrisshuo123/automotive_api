# Automotive APIs

This project mainly showcases my ability in creating Pointer APIs using Golang MVC to show it via HTML Template Frontend and Postman API. For the Postman API, I'll Update how to set this up starting by setting up the MySQL DB.

## Future Release:
- 3D Asset Vehicles per API (Starts from models, but soon can be playable in UNITY 3D. Please take Note: Only Lowpoly Assets) ⏹🚗🚘
